EXERCISE 2 : DATA HANDLING IN APIS

In this link, you will find the documentation for the API of a pet store: https://petstore.swagger.io/

Create your user through an HTTP request and then retrieve its data by calling the corresponding service.

Collect, through an HTTP request, the JSON returned by the endpoint /pet/findByStatus, and list, using a function, the names of the pets that have been sold.

The output format should consist of the tuple {id, name}.

You can use the data structure of your preference.

Create a class whose constructor requires the earlier data structure and implement a method that can iterate through it to identify how many pets share the same name.

Example output: {"William": 11, "Floyd": 2}. As output, we request the code (you can separate it into files as you prefer) and the results from the previous points.

Remember that you can use the language and technology of your choice, and any additional improvements will be well considered.
